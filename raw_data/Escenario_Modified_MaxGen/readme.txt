DEMAND
This scenario has 787 MW of generation out of the 820 MW available. 

CONTROLLERS
Controllers were changed so that all generators are GENROU and all of them have SCRX excitation system. 
G1 is TGOV1 and G2 and G3 are GAST for their turbine-governor system.

CONTINGENCY ANALYSIS
The contingency analysis is critical now with some contingencies causing a 0.74 p.u (LIN 7-8 causes low voltage on BUS8).
Also, there are critical overloads on lines under N-1 analysis. 

TIME DOMAIN SIMULATION
Initialization is perfect and performance to 3ph short circuit is excellent.
